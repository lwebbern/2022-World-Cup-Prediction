 my model predicted the following for the group stage results (highlighted in green means they will follow into the play-offs):

My model correctly predicted France as the semi-finalist, and predicted Netherlands as the winner of the world cup, the team who it also predicted to beat Argentina (the actual winners)

And the following was the actual bracket, with Argentina as the winners:
