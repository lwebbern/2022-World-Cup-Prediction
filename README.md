 my model predicted the following for the group stage results (highlighted in green means they will follow into the play-offs):

thus, using the seeding rules, i built the following bracket, and at each staged marked the winner and loser.

My model correctly predicted France as the semi-finalist, and predicted Netherlands as the winner of the world cup, the team who it also predicted to beat Argentina (the actual winners)

## Actual Outcome

Here was the actual group stage outcome:

And the following was the actual bracket, with Argentina as the winners:

## Results
Overall, my model had some predictive power.
It predicted 10/16 teams correctly to qualify to the play-offs


I aim to revisit this next year
